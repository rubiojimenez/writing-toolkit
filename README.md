# Writing Toolkit

Curated collection of LaTeX templates and document-building utilities for **streamlining writing**.

I wrote these tools for my own use and I refine them as I go. 
Some are still tailored to my personal workflow, but should be straightforward to adapt.

The repository also includes my VSCodium setup, which I use for Python, HTML, CSS, and occasionally LaTeX and Markdown. 

For focused writing I prefer Texmaker, while collaborative projects tend to end up on Overleaf.
For Markdown and other plain text files I prefer Kate.
I sometimes brainstorm in Writer because it feels more like working on paper.
I have no automation for these workflows, so they are not represented here.

At present, the repository focuses on scientific writing, though I expect it to evolve into a more general writing toolkit over time.

## A modular writing architecture

For my LaTeX documents, I have adopted a modular preamble separating packages, configuration and macros:

```text
preamble/
├── config.tex
├── macros.tex
└── packages.tex
```

This makes templates easier to use and maintain. 

I am gradually migrating older templates to this structure.


## Templates

The document types covered are

- journal articles;
- technical notes;
- referee responses;
- conference abstracts;
- abstract collections;
- research proposals; and
- cover letters.

For each document, both

```text
main.tex
main.pdf
```

are provided to allow a quick preview of the final output.

I use the Libertinus typeface together with the corresponding Libertinus math font.
Besides liking their appearance, they are open source, widely available, and produce consistent output across Linux, macOS and Windows.
For proposals and cover letters, however, I switch to sans serif to make them easier to read.

## Command-line utilities

Helper scripts are also provided for automating repetitive tasks:

`builddown`: Converts Markdown documents into PDF using Pandoc and XeLaTeX.

`buildtex`: A wrapper around the standard LaTeX toolchain supporting

- PDF compilation with BibTeX, including bibunits;
- generation of files for arXiv submission;
- project cleanup; and
- standard compilation while retaining intermediate files.

`gitush`: A wrapper around

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "<message>"
git push
```

It is intended for the case where everything is ready to go.

`sortbib`: Sorts BibTeX databases alphabetically by entry key and orders the fields likewise within each entry.

I use this less nowadays in favour of JabRef, but it is still useful when handling BibTeX files directly.

`startop`: Launches my preferred working environment. 

My workflow is essentially filesystem-first, so I usually work from Dolphin, using its integrated terminal and launching external editors as needed.

## Requirements

Depending on which templates and utilities you use, the following may be required:

- TeX Live;
- XeLaTeX;
- Pandoc;
- Python 3 with the required modules; and
- Git.

Additionally,

- `startop` requires Dolphin and VSCodium.

Suggestions and contributions of additional templates are welcome.
